## Data Science Project Python Template

This template can be used to structure your Python data science projects. It is based on [Cookie Cutter Data Science](https://drivendata.github.io/cookiecutter-data-science/). A logical, reasonably standardized, but flexible project structure for doing and sharing data science work.
